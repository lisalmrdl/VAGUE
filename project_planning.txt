Our project is to create a search engine focused on video games. This engine will allow users to search our database of 10,000 games. Searches can be specific, based on the game's genre, its exact name, or simply a keyword to find games related to a particular theme.

This application makes it easier to navigate a selection of games than the industry standard: Steam. Steam searches are complex because there are so many games, and new ones are added daily. With a fixed database, the results vary less, making it simpler to find a game you were previously interested in.

Our database is based on the OpenCritic API, which web-crawls all video game reviews. Our database was extracted on January 16, 2026.
