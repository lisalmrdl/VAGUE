# VAGUE
Group repository for Video-game Approximate Game-finding Utility Engine (V.A.G.U.E)


## Overview
This project is a search engine focused on video games that allows users to search our database of 10,000 games. 
Searches can be specific, based on the game's genre, its exact name, or simply a keyword to find games related to a particular theme.



## Motivation

Industry standards, i.e. Steam, offer varying search results depending on different factors such as the day of the inquery.
VAGUE simplifies navigating through an overwhelming amount of data by streamlining the search process through a fixed database.
